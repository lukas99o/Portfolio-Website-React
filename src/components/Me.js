                    <span>My</span> name is Lukas Olsson, and I live in Stockholm, Sweden, sharing an apartment with my lovely girlfriend and our cat. 
                    In my free time, I enjoy activities where movement is involved, such as going to the gym, walking in nature, going for runs and hanging out with my girlfriend and friends.
                    I also have a passion for coding my own projects and gaming whenever I find a quality game that captures my interest.

                        My journey into the world of programming began about three years ago when I developed an interest in creating my own video game. 
                        However, I soon realized that game development was far more challenging than I initially thoguht. So I started a self-learning journey to learn programming.
                        I started my learning journey with FreeCodeCamp, a platform where I delved into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

                        As my passion for programming grew, I decided to pursue formal education in the field. I decided to take a 2 year program at Chas Acadmey, where we learned .Net fullstack development. 
                        I completed my studies may 20th 2025 and I am looking for any work related to development with a preference in .Net fullstack development.
